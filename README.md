## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/lajak/college-carclinch-ai
    cd college-carclinch-ai
    ```

2. **Set Up Backend**
    ```
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # or
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Up Frontend**
    ```
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the Application**
    ```
    # Start backend (from backend/)
    python app.py
    # or
    npm run start

    # Start frontend (from frontend/)
    npm start
    ```

5. **Access the App**
    - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or as instructed).

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)
- **Frontend**: ReactJS/Angular
- **AI/ML**: scikit-learn, pandas, or equivalent
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose

## AI/Recommendation Engine

- Utilizes machine learning for personalized car suggestions.
- Trained on historical user, preference, and inventory data.
- Continually improved as new data is added.

## Development & Deployment

- Run locally via Docker Compose:
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
- Or deploy backend and frontend separately (see above).
- Scripts in `/scripts` help automate setup and data loading.
